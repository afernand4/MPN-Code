This was the code for my MPN Neighborhood Survey analysis. This code includes cleaning, rearranging, and merging two data sets-- one in English and the other in Spanish to create onemaster data set that had undergone several changes and variable creations to tailor more specific analysis for MPN's groups of interest. Through calculating percentages for both univariate and crosstab analysis, and comparing these percentages to longitudinal trends (the survey has been conducted since 2014), I was able to evaluate MPN's impact, provide recommendations to improve experiences of low-income Latino families in SF through MPN Services, and revise survey questions that can provide specific insights. 

This was a great project I worked on as a Data Analysis and Planning Intern at MEDA!

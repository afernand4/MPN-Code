Code for my MPN Neighborhood Survey analysis. This code includes cleaning, rearranging, and merging two data sets, one in English and the other in Spanish. Then creating some new variables for specific analysis to determine MPN's impact. Next is code that helps me compute percentages for both univariate and Crosstab analysis

This was a great project I worked on as a Data Analysis and Planning Intern at MEDA. Excited to continue working with data to discover important insights.
